# Becoming Agile: Introducing the Retrospective

There are many software companies that transition from a waterfall methodology to an agile methodology to more effectively adapt as the customer's understanding of the requirements evolves and the scope is refined.  In contrast, there are companies that move from a "do anything you like" way of organizing work to an agile way of work in order to gain total team involvement in moving towards a defined set of goals.  No matter the end of the spectrum you are approaching agile from, invariably there is period of transition where agile practices are being ramped up and prior practices are adapted or discarded.

At the first phase of this transition, I believe there is no more important practice to adopt than the Retrospective.  An Agile Retrospective is a meeting that is held at the end of some predefined period of time, often referred to as an iteration or sprint.  The Agile Retrospective is born from the heart of the Principles behind the Agile Manifesto which state that, 
	"At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly."
