For anyone else curious about how Microsoft is now developing desktop applications, here's some info on Microsoft Teams:
The Microsoft Teams app is built with Angular, TypeScript, & HTML. This web-based application is then wrapped with the Electron shell just like VSCode.  The desktop client shares the same code as the Microsoft Teams web client.

## How Does This Apply to Me?
Worth noting, here are some potential non-functional requirements of the Teams client that may differ from your needs:
* Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac)
* Share code between desktop and web
* Prove out modern web technologies in a greenfield product
* Cloud backend support
